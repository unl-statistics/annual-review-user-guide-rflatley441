2. I did some find-replace to figure out that quarto likes $...$ rather than \(...\). I suspect it also prefers $$...$$ to \[...\].

3. You need to use hierarchical headings, so don't go from # to ### or you'll get a 1.0.1 instead of 1.1 in your section numbering.

4. It helps to use figure captions/labels so you can reference the figure number in the text. Look up how to accomplish that in quarto :).

5. Additional resources including this "Quarto books: For building and customizing this report, see the Quarto book documentation."?

6. Figure out why your refs aren't included in the references section and are instead at the bottom of each section.
